# LAA Knowledge Candies

The benefits of the Weekly Knowledge Candy sessions are:

* Little easy digestible topics
* Developers train their ability to give presentations and speeches
* 10 to 15 minutes focus helps to understand a topic
* Every developer is focusing on their weakest topics. This way the whole team is gaining the most benefits.

## Pick a topic

Developers are encouraged to pick a topic and prepare it to present in any way they like. That can be on a whiteboard, PowerPoint, purely code, or most often a mixture of several forms.

Everyone should try to pick the topic they're the most unfamiliar with. Picking the topic they have the weakest knowledge gives the developers the opportunity to learn and earn the most out of these sessions because it’s not just simple repetition for them.

## Requirements

* 10-15 minutes long
* Document the topic so it's self-explanatory. That way developers who haven’t been able to attend can read it whenever they like.

## How

1. Create a [new "Present a topic" issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-knowledge-candies/issues/new/choose)
1. Complete all sections of the template (feel free to delete the checklist)
1. Feel free to edit the issue description with supplementary details, before or after you're presentation

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much time does it take to prepare?**

It'll depend on two things:

* what level of details you choose for your transcript. Writing is definitely the part that takes the most time. It may take two hours to properly write down all the contents of a 10 minutes talk. I strongly advise that you leave some trace of your talk, so that people can get back to it later, but the way you do it is really up to you. You can even just film the session and upload the video.
* How well you know the subject before starting. If you have to conduct research and experiments to build the contents of you talk, then the sky is the limit. But if you know it fairly well, I found that it only takes a few minutes to structure your 10 minutes intervention.

**How often am I expected to present?**
At the moment, we decided on 1 or 2 presentations per week. We currently have 27 Civil Servant developers. At this rate, it'd be every 3 months. In the future, we may up the frequency of presentations per week if it's not too taxing.
